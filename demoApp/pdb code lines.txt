TO USE PDB WE HAVE TWO METHODS:
1. TO IMPORT PDB AND GIVE A MANUAL BREAK POINT IN CODE BY PDB.TRACE()
2. RUN THE PROGRAM WITH PYTHON -M PDB filename
3. RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON BY IMPORTING FILE AND IMPORT PDB AND GIEV PDB.RUN('FILENAME.FUNCTION')

ALL THE STEPS ARE SIMILAR IN APPROACH BUT 
	THE 1ST STEP WILL REQUIRE US TO ENTER MANUALLY THE BREAK POINT
	THE 2ND STEP WILL STOP AND ACT AS DEBUGGER FROM THE START
	THE 3RD STEP WILL ALSO STOP AT THE START AND ACT AS DEBUGGER

COMMAND TO PASS IN PDB
NOTE: Remember that our PDB will take the last command enter as the input when simply entered

HELP OR H WILL LIST ALL THE COMMAND IN PDB

	P varName	# To print the variable value at the point of program
	where		# This is given to tell us where we are in prog
	whatis varName	# This will return us the type of varName Function
	step 		# This can be used to step into the function or class name
	break		# We can set break point from pdb interface using BREAK LINE NUMBER | FUNCTION NAME
	c		# Short for Continue
	l		# To print an 11 lines of code for checking purpose
	l .		# To goto the top of the program but this no =t much used
	ll		# LONG LIST To see the current function we are in	
	
	p getattr(funcName, arg)	# To run an particular function we can use it 
	pp getattr(funcName, arg)	# TO run a large display like dict or list
