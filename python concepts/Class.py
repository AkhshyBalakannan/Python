# In class we have an instance method which can be found using
# m.__self__ as the instance method m() and m.__func is the
# function object corresponding to the method

# Special Attributes

# object.__dict__
    # A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an objectâ€™s(writable) attributes.

# instance.__class__
# The class to which a class instance belongs.

# class.__bases__
# The tuple of base classes of a class object.

# definition.__name__
# The name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance.

# definition.__qualname__
# The qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance.

# class.__mro__
# This attribute is a tuple of classes that are considered when looking
# for base classes during method resolution.

# class.mro()
# This method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method
# resolution order for its instances. It is called at class instantiation,
# and its result is stored in __mro__.

# class.__subclasses__()
# Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses.
# This method returns a list of all those references still alive. Example:

# int.__subclasses__()
# [ < class 'bool' > ]
